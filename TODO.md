# TO DO



---

Test specs must be defined and written starting from the CSV data files. Try and document.

---

Un-wire that 414@2x, 375@3x from extraction and calculate it using resolutions data and usage (414@2x is currently the wider & most-used smartphone, 375@3x is the most used)

---

Automate all the logic that are actually inside the formulas (mind-blowing?)

---

Add statically generated pages and tags, for easier copy and paste and easier testing. Express.js would be used only by jest for testing purposes.

---

Support adaptive websites (smartphone + desktop|tablet), e.g. by adding the ability to set a user agent for each extraction || a cookie to force the version.

---

Automatically round `vw` to `10vw` or amongst groups of `10vw`, instead of asking users to do it manually.
