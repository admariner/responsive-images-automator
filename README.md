# Responsive images automator

This tool is useful to:

1. extract rendered CSS width from your pages
2. generate the image tags (after you added intrinsic width to your data)
3. test the generated image tags


## EXTRACT RENDERED CSS WIDTHS

Extract images `width` in CSS pixels and in `vw` unit from pages, using puppeteer.

### required config 

- `config/resolutions.csv`
- `config/extraction.csv`
- `config/blacklisted_domains.js`
- `config/blacklisted_paths.js`

### command 

`npm run extract`

### output

- `data/{pageName}-extracted.csv`


## ADD INTRINSIC WIDTHS

Defining the intrinsic width of the images would be your only manual step. 
Don't panic, we got your back.

### PREPARE THE CANVAS

- Open extracted data (`/data/{pageName}-extracted.csv`) in Excel
- Save it temporarily in Excel format with file name (`/data/{pageName}-temp.xls`)
- Copy and paste the calculated columns from `./wizardry/magic-formulas.xlsx`, sheets `Capped Images Formulas` for 2x capping and `Uncapped Images Formulas` for uncapped images.

### DEFINE INTRINSIC WIDTHS

You'll need to define ideal images' intrinsic widths in order to have a few (5 or 6) final image dimensions and minimise waste.

The magic formulas you've pasted in the rightmost columns will guide you.

- Try and reuse the `intrinsicWidth` in all other resolutions (rows)
- Adjust `intrinsicWidth` where you see "POOR" or "BIG" indications in the `isOK` column. 
  You can copy values from the `idealIntrinsicWidth_capped2x` column in PLP, `idealIntrinsicWidth` in PDP.
  You might accept a "BIG" on rarely used resolutions, e.g. 320@2x.
- Now check: do you have similar `intrinsicWidth` values? 
  If you do, group them by using one of the similar values. It is generally a good idea to use the one that corresponds to the most used resolution. Do that and check again the `isOK` column and adjust where needed.

--- END - ðŸ‘€ Steps to repeat for each page ---

### POLISH VW

In the Uncapped Images Page data, it's important to group together similar values of the `imgVW` column. So if you have values like `39`, `40`, `41`, `43`, `44` you can probably set them all to `44`. This will allow the tag-generation script to generate ligher HTML code for the same results.

### MULTIPLE PAGES REFINEMENT

Reusing the same dimensions across pages will leverage CDN cache and browser cache for all of your users.

So check again: do you have similar `intrinsicWidth` values ACROSS PAGES?

To check this, copy all the `intrinsicWidth` from the listing page and uncapped images page in a new sheet, sort the values and remove the duplicates. Calculate the delta between each of the widths, it's usually a bad practice to have deltas < 100 pixels.

If you do have similar `intrinsicWidth` values, group them by using one of the similar values and repeat the process. 

This new sheet will also give you a list of all the dimensions (widths) as an outcome, to pass as a config to your image processing tool.


### FEED BACK THE AUTOMATOR

Once you've finished adjusting the _intrinsicWidth_ column, export data in the CSV format as `/data/{pageName}.csv`.


## GENERATE IMAGE TAGS

Launch the server and visit pages to get the image tags you'd need.

`npm run start`

- Capped: http://localhost:8080/capped/
- Uncapped: http://localhost:8080/uncapped/

Use developer tools to inspect the images, right-click, copy outerHtml


## TEST GENERATED IMAGE TAGS

Test the generated tag to understand if browsers will download images of the intrinsic width you selected.
 
### required step

`npm run start`
`npm run start:dev` for auto-reload with nodemon

### required config

- `views/__tests__/uncapped.ejs.test.js`
- `views/__tests__/capped.ejs.test.js`

### test (in another terminal window)

`npm run test`
`npm run test:dev` for watch mode
